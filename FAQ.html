            <div class="answer">
                <p>This depends on the pricing plan that you select. If you go for the “Unlimited kms” pricing plans (available only without fuel, and only for bookings whose duration is more than 24 hours), there is absolutely no limit to the kilometres that you can drive, and you have complete flexibility of driving the car as much as you want. Revv it up! Other pricing plans have a "Kilometres limit", which varies based on the plan selected. You can still drive beyond the kilometres limit, but the additional kilometres clocked will attract an additional charge</p>
